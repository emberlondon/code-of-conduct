# Ember London - Code of Conduct

We want everyone to feel welcome, comfortable, and included in the Ember London
community.

Any behaviour which makes people feel otherwise **will not be tolerated**.

This means behaviour in talks, at the pub afterwards, at our project nights,
and online in Slack or Twitter.

In short, we won’t tolerate harassment.

Harassment includes, but is not strictly limited to: offensive verbal comments
related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual
images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness harassing behaviour, please report it to a member
of the volunteer team:

- Jamie White ([@jgwhite](https://twitter.com/jgwhite), [jamie@jgwhite.co.uk](mailto:jamie@jgwhite.co.uk))
- Ken Snyder ([@yankeeinlondon](https://twitter.com/yankeeinlondon), [ken@ken.net](mailto:ken@ken.net))

Members of the team present at events will identify themselves for in-person
reporting.

We will take your report seriously, in confidence, and take immediate action.
Feel free to report at any moment, no matter how much time has passed since the
incident.

If you’d like to join the volunteer team please contact one of the volunteers
above.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Ember London team may take
any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Ember
London spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other
members or the general public.
